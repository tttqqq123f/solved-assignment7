Design the pseudocode/flowchart for a program that outputs numbers in reverse

order from 10 down to 1. Your output should go to the console window. Use a loop with step -1.

Design the pseudocode/flowchart for a program that uses a while loop to output numbers between 0 and 100, stepping by 5. (ie. 0, 5, 10, 15…) Your output should go to the console window.

Write the pseudo-code/flowchart for an application that calculates the Celsius equivalent to Fahrenheit Temperatures. The Fahrenheit temps should start at 0 and go up to 300, incrementing 20 each time through the loop. (Formula is: Celsius = (Fahrenheit-32.0)  (5.0/9.0)). Your output should be displayed on the Console Window. Don’t worry about formatting the Celsius data




Secondhand Rose Resale Shop is having a seven-day sale during which the price   of any unsold item drops 10 percent each day. For example, an item that costs  $10.00 on the first day costs 10 percent less, or $9.00, on the second day.  On the third day, the same item is 10 percent less than $9.00, or $8.10.

Design the pseudo-code/flowchart using Visual Logic that allows a user to input a price. Output is the price of each item on each day, one through  seven.
